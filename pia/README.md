## The Project in a Nutshell
This project has been done with the purpose to help the storebooks to maintain their establishments in order. The program gives you the main functions to manage your own bookstore. The program is not only useful to small bookstores, also you can use it with big bookstores that need to know where is any book on any section. To organize your library the code has three main functions. They are going to appear like this:

[1] - Add a new section

[2] - Add a new book

[3] - Ask for a book

For next, I am going to explain these functions and what you have to do when you select one of them.
### Add a New Section
This function is the first one you must select to start using this code. When you are in the main functions press number 1 to open the function [Add a new section]. The sections are essentials because in these sections you'll put your books. In other words, without a section you can't use the another other functions. You must add at least 1 section.

Once you press the one the program will ask you for the name of the sections. If you want to order your bookstore according to the kind of book you can select names like horror, comedy, adventures, fantasy, etc. Then you can add books in those sections. If you want to organize your bookstore in other way you can do it. 

When you finish the process one message is going to tell you how many sections you have at the moment. You can add all the sections that you want.

### Add a New Book
When your bookstore gets more books or if you already have, you can add these books to your sections in this program. Press the number 2 to open this function. The program is going to ask you first in which library you want to add this book and a list of your sections previously registered is going to be printed. All the sections are going to have a number on the left side that corresponds with which was registered first. You must press the number of the section where you want to add the book. Then the program is going to ask you the name of the book and after that will ask for the author.

As in the other function you can register as many books as you want.

### Ask For a Book
With this function you will be able to search the books that you registered. Press number 3 on the main functions to access. The program will ask you the name of the book, be careful, you must give it the correct name. When you give it the name the program will tell you in which section is the book and who is the author.

### After Use a Function
When you finish using a function, the program will ask you if you want to continue. If you want to continue just press number 1, but if you want to leave press number 2.

## Demo
If you want to see demonstration of how this program works click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=enOsz2AGQrg) and you will see a video using and testing this program.

## Compiling
If you have already read and understand how the program works download the next files from my project folder:
* bookstore.c
* shelve.h

Make sure that the names of the files still being the corrects, specially for shelve.h file. Then compile bookstore.c, and that is all.
